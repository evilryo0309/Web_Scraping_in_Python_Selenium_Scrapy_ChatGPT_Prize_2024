13 meters. You should see it. Okay, take her up and over the bow rail. Mir 2, we're going over the bow. Stay with us. Okay, quiet. We're rolling. Seeing her coming out of the darkness like a ghost ship... ...still gets me every time. To see the sad ruin of the great ship sitting here... ...where she landed at 2:30 in the morning Of April 15, 1912 ...after her long fall... ...from the world above. You are so full of shit, boss. Dive 6. Here we are again on the deck of Titanic. 2% miles down 3,821 meters- The pressure outside is 3% tons per square inch These windows are 9 inches thick. If they go, it's sayonara in two microseconds. All right, enough of that bullshit. Just put her down on the roof of the officers' quarters like yesterday. Mir 2, we're landing right over the Grand Staircase. You guys set to launch? Yeah, Brock. Launching Dunkin now. Go, Charlie. - All right, tether out. - Tether out. Okay, Brock, we're dropping down along the hull. Yeah, roger that- Okay, drop down and go into the first class gangway door- I want you guys working the D deck... ...reception area and the dining saloon. Copy that. Tether out. Okay, now left. Left, left. Okay, coming left. Snoop Dog is on the move. We're headed down the stairwell. Okay Lewis, drop down to B deck. - Okay, A deck. - Give me some rope, Captain. B deck. Get in there. Get in there. Watch the door frame. - Watch it, watch it. - I see it. I got it. - We good? Bring her down. - We're good. Just chill, boss. Okay, make your turn. - Cable out, Captain. - Make your turn. Watch the wall. Yeah Brock, we're at the piano. You copy? Okay, copy that. Okay, right there. Right there. Okay, that's it, that's it. That's the bedroom door. I see it. I see it. We're in! We're in, baby. We're there. That's Hockley's bed. That's where the son of a bitch slept. Oops. Somebody left the water running. Hold it. Hold it just a second. Go back to the right. That wardrobe door. Get closer. You smelling something, boss? - I want to see what's under it. - Give me my hands, man. All right. - Take it easy. It might come apart. - Okay. Go, go, go. Flip it over. Flip it over. Go. Turn her over. Keep going. Go, Q0, 9°- Okay, drop it. Oh, baby, baby. Are you seeing this, boss? It's payday, boys. Cha-ching! - We did it, Bobby. - We brought it back, Baby. Oh, yeah! Who's the best? Who's the best, baby? Say it. Say it. Say it. You are, Lewis. - Bobby, my cigar. - Right here. Okay, crack her open. Shit. No diamond. You know boss, this same thing happened to Geraldo and his career never recovered. Turn the camera off. Brock, the partners would like to know how it's going. Hey, Dave, Barry, hi. Look, I it wasn't in the safe. But hey, hey... ...Don't worry about it. There's still plenty of places it could be. Hell, yes. The floor debris in the suite, the mother's room... the purser's safe on C deck. Jimmy Hoffa's briefcase. A dozen other places. Guys, look, you're just going to have to trust my instincts. I know we're close. We've just got to go through a little process of elimination. Hang on a second. - Let me see that. - Ah, we may have something here, guys. Where's the photograph of the necklace? We'll call you right back. I'll be goddamned. Treasure hunter Brock Lovett is best known for finding Spanish gold... It's okay. I'll feed you in a minute. Now he has chartered Russian subs to reach the most famous shipwreck of all, the Titanic. He is with us live via satellite from the research ship Keldysh... ...in the North Atlantic. Hello, Brock. Hello, Tracy. Of course, everyone knows the familiar stories of Titanic. You know, the nobility of the band playing to the very end and all that. But what I'm interested in are the untold stories. The secrets locked deep inside the hull of Titanic. And we're out here using robot technology to go further into the wreck... ...than anybody has ever done before. Your expedition is at the center of a storm of controversy... ...over salvage rights and even ethics. Many are calling you a graverobber. Well, nobody ever called the recovery of the artifacts... What is it? Turn that up, dear. I have museum-trained experts sent out here making sure... ---that these relics are preserved and catalogued properly. Take a look at this drawing that we found just today. A piece of paper that's been underwater for 84 years. And my team are able to preserve it intact. Should this have remained unseen at the bottom of the ocean for eternity... ...when we can see and enjoy it now? I'll be goddamned. Brock! There's a satellite call for you. Bobby, we're launching. You see these submersibles going in the water? Trust me, buddy. You want to take this call. This better be good. Now, you gotta speak up. She's kind of old. Great. This is Brock Lovett. How can I help you, Mrs...? Calvert. Rose Calvert. Mrs. Calvert. I was just wondering if you had found... ...the "Heart of the Ocean" yet, Mr. Lovett. Told you you wanted to take the call. All right, you have my attention, Rose. Can you tell us who the woman in the picture is? Oh, yes. The woman in the picture is me. She's a goddamn liar! Some nutcase seeking money or publicity. God only knows why. Like that Russian babe, Anesthesia. They're inbound! Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the Titanic when she was 17, right? - That's right. - If she had lived, she'd be over 100 by now. 101 next month. Okay, so she's a very old goddamn liar. Look, I've already done the background on this woman... ...all the way back to the 20s, when she was working as an actress. An actress. There's your first clue, Sherlock. Her name was Rose Dawson back then. Then she marries this guy named Calvert. They move to Cedar Rapids and she punches out a couple of kids. Now Calvert's dead and, from what I hear, Cedar Rapids is dead. And everybody who knows about the diamond is supposed to be dead... ...or on this boat, but she knows. Doesn't exactly travel light, does she? Hurry up, give him a hand. Mrs. Calvert, I'm Brock Lovett. Welcome to the Keldysh. Okay, let's get her inside there. Hi, Miss Calvert. - Hi. - Welcome to the Keldysh. Thanks. Hey! Are your staterooms all right? Oh, yes. Very nice. Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy? She takes care of me. We met just a few minutes ago. Remember, Nana? Up on deck? Oh, yes. There. That's nice. Have to have my pictures when I travel. Can I get you anything? Is there anything you'd like? Yes. I would like to see my drawing. Louis XVI wore a fabulous stone that was... ...called the Blue Diamond of the Crown... ...which disappeared in 1792... ...about the same time old Louis lost everything from the neck up. The theory goes that the crown diamond was chopped, too. Recut into a heart-like shape that became known as... ...the Heart of the Ocean. Today it would be worth more than the Hope diamond. It was a dreadful, heavy thing. I only wore it this once. You actually think this is you, Nana? It is me, dear. Wasn't I a dish? I tracked it down through insurance records. An old claim that was settled under terms of absolute secrecy. Can you tell me who the claimant was, Rose? I should imagine someone named Hockley. Nathan Hockley, that's right. Pittsburgh steel tycoon. The claim was for a diamond necklace his son... ...Caledon, bought his fiancée. You. A week before he sailed on Titanic. And it was filed right after the sinking. So the diamond had to have gone down with the ship. You see the date? April 14, 1912 Which means if your grandmother is who she says she is... ...she was wearing the diamond the day the Titanic sank. And that makes you my new best friend. These are some of the things we recovered from your stateroom. This was mine. How extraordinary. And it looks the same as it did the last time I saw it. The reflection has changed a bit. Are you ready to go back to Titanic? Okay, here we go. She hits the berg on the starboard side, right? She kind of bumps along... ...punching holes like morse code... -- dit-dit-dit -- along the side... ...below the waterline. Then the forward compartments start to flood. Now, as the water level rises... ...it spills over the watertight bulkheads... which, unfortunately, don't go any higher than E deck- So now as the bow goes down... ...the stern rises up, slow at first... ...then faster and faster... ...until finally, she's got her whole ass sticking up in the air. And that's a big ass. We're talking 20, 30,000 tons. Okay? And the hull's not designed to deal with that pressure. So, what happens? She splits, right down to the keel. And the stern... ...falls back level. Then... ...as the bow sinks... ...it pulls the stern vertical... ...and then finally detaches. Now the stern section just kind of bobs there like a cork for a couple of minutes... ...floods, and finally goes under about 2:20 AM... ...2 hours and 40 minutes after the collision. The bow section planes away... ...landing about a half a mile away... ...going 20, 30 knots when it hits the ocean floor. Pretty cool, huh? Thank you for that fine forensic analysis, Mr. Bodine. Of course, the experience of it was... ...somewhat different. Will you share it with us? I'm taking her to rest. No. Come on, Nana. No! Give me the tape recorder. Tell us, Rose. It's been 84 years-- It's okay. Just try to remember anything... ...anything at all. Do you want to hear this or not, Mr. Lovett? It's been 84 years... ...and I can still smell the fresh paint. The china had never been used. The sheets had never been slept in. Titanic was called the ship of dreams. And it was. It really was. All third-class passengers... ...with a forward berth... ...this way please! This queue! It's a big boat, huh? Daddy, it's a ship. You're right. I don't see what all the fuss is about. It doesn't look any bigger than the Mauretania. You can be blasé about some things, Rose... ...but not about Titanic. It's over 100 feet longer than Mauretania... ...and far more luxurious. Your daughter is far too difficult to impress, Ruth. So this is the ship they say is unsinkable. It is unsinkable. God Himself could not sink this ship-- Wh at?! You have to check your baggage through the main terminal. It's round that way, sir. I put my faith in you good sir. Now kindly see my man. Yes sir. It's my pleasure, sir. If I can do anything at all... Yes, right. All the trunks from that car there- 12 from here. And the safe, to the parlor suite... ...rooms B-52, 54, 56. Ladies... ...we better hurry. Come along. - My coat? - I have it, miss. All third-class passengers queue here for health inspection. - Welcome aboard, ma'am. - Welcome to Titanic. It was the ship of dreams... ...to everyone else. To me, it was a slave ship... ...taking me back to America in chains. Outwardly, I was everything a Well brought up girl should be- Inside, I was screaming. Jack, you are pazzo. You bet everything we have. When you got nothing, you got nothing to lose. Sven? All right, moment of truth. Someone's life is about to change. Fabrizio? Niente. Olaf? Nothing. Sven? Uh-oh. 2 pair. I'm sorry, Fabrizio. I'm sorry... ...you're not gonna see your mom again for a... ...long time... ...'cause we're going to America. Full house, boys! Come on. I'm going home! I'm going home. I go to America! No, mate. Titanic go to America, in 5 minutes. Shit. Fabri. Come on. Come on, here. Here. We're riding in high style now! We're a couple of regular swells. We're practically goddamn royalty... ...ragazzo mio. You see? ls my destine. Like I told you... I go to America to be millionaire. You are pazzo. Maybe, but I've got the tickets. Come on, I thought you were fast. Aspettal Whoa. Wait! Wait! Hey, wait! We're passengers! Have you been through the inspection queue? Of course. Anyway, we don't have any lice. We're Americans. Both of us. Right. Come aboard. We're the luckiest sons of bitches in the world. You know that? Good-bye! You know somebody? Of course not. That's not the point. Good-bye! I'll miss you! Good-bye! I will never forget you! Come with me, darling. Let's go. G-60. G-60. G-60. Excuse me, ma'am. G-60. Oh, right here. Hey, how you doing? Jack. Nice to meet you. Jack Dawson. Nice to meet you. How you doing? Who says you get top bunk, huh? This is your private promenade deck, sir. Will you be requiring anything? Excuse me. - This one? - No. It had a lot of faces on it. This is the one. Would you like all of them out, miss? Yes. We need a little color in this room. Put in there. In the wardrobe. God, not those finger paintings again. They certainly were a waste of money. The difference between Cal's taste in art... ...and mine is that I have some. They're fascinating. Like being inside a dream or something. There's truth but no logic. - What's the artist's name? - Something Picasso. Something Picasso. He won't amount to a thing. He won't, trust me. - Let's put the Degas in the bedroom. - At least they were cheap. Put it in the wardrobe. At Cherbourg, a woman came aboard named Margaret Brown. We all called her Molly. History would call her the Unsinkable Molly Brown. Well, I wasn't about to wait all day for you, sonny. Here, if you think you can manage. Her husband had struck gold someplace out west. And she was what Mother called "new money." By the next afternoon... ...we were steaming west from the coast of Ireland... ...with nothing out ahead of us but ocean. Take herto sea, Mr. Murdoch. Let's stretch her legs. Yes sir. All ahead full, Mr. Moody. Very good, sir. All ahead full. All ahead full! Come on lads, step lively! All right! Let's stoke her right up! We go full ahead! Come on, put your backs into it! 21 knots, sir. Hey, look, look, look! See it? There's another one! See him? Look at that one! Look at him jump! I can see the Statue of Liberty already. Very small, of course. I'm the king of the world! She is the largest moving object ever made by the hand of man... ...in all history. And our master shipbuilder, Mr. Andrews here... ...designed her from the keel plates up. I may have knocked her together, but--- ...the idea was Mr. lsmay's. He envisioned a steamer so grand in scale... ...and so luxurious in... ...its appointments... ...that its supremacy would never be challenged. And here she is. - Willed into solid reality. - Hear, hear. I'll have the salmon. You know I don't like that, Rose. She knows. We'll both have the lamb. Rare, with very little mint sauce. You like lamb, right sweet pea? You gonna cut her meat for her too there, Cal? Hey, who thought of the name Titanic? Was it you, Bruce? Yes, actually. I wanted to convey sheer size. And size means stability... ...luxury, and above all, strength. Do you know of Dr. Freud, Mr. lsmay? His ideas about the male preoccupation with size might be of particular interest to you. What's gotten into you? Excuse me. I do apologize. She's a pistol, Cal. Hope you can handle her. Well, I may have to start minding what she reads from now on, won't I, Mrs. Brown? Freud? Who is he? Is he a passenger? The ship is nice, huh? Yeah. It's an Irish ship. Is English, no? No, it was built in Ireland. 15,000 lrishmen built this ship. Solid as a rock. Big Irish hands. That's typical. First-class dogs come down here to take a shite. Lets us know where we rank in the scheme of things. Like we could forget? I'm Tommy Ryan. - Jack Dawson. - Fabrizio. Do you make any money with your drawings? Ah, forget it, boyo. You'd as like have angels fly out of your arse as get next to... ...the likes of her. I saw my whole life as if I'd already lived it. An endless parade of parties and cotillions... yachts and polo matches. Always the same narrow people, the same mindless chatter. I felt like I was standing at a great precipice... ...with no one to pull me back. No one who cared... ...or even noticed. Don't do it. Stay back. Don't come any closer. Come on. Just give me your hand. I'll pull you back over. No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go. No, you won't. What do you mean, no I won't? Don't presume to tell me what I will and will not do. You don't know me. Well, you would have done it already. You're distracting me. Go away. I can't. I'm involved now. You let go, and I'm going to have to jump in there after you. Don't be absurd. - You'll be killed. - I'm a good swimmer. The fall alone will kill you. It would hurt. I'm not saying it wouldn't. Tell you the truth... ...I'm a lot more concerned about that water being so cold. How cold? Freezing. Maybe a couple degrees over. You ever, uh... ...ever been to Wisconsin? Wh at? Well, they have some of the coldest winters around. I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls. I remember when I was a kid, me and my father, we went ice fishing... ...out on Lake Wissota. Ice fishing is, you know, where you-- I know what ice fishing is! Sorry. You just seem like, you know, kind of an indoor girl. Anyway, I... ...fell through some thin ice. And I'm telling you... ...water that cold, like right down there... ...it hits you like 1000 knives stabbing you all over your body. You can't breathe. You can't think. Least not about anything but the pain. Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in there after you. Like I said... ...I don't have a choice. I guess I'm kind of hoping you'll come back over the rail and... ...and get me off the hook here. You're crazy. That's what everybody says but... ...with all due respect, miss... ...I'm not the one hanging off the back of a ship here. Come on. Come on, give me your hand. You don't want to do this. I'm Jack Dawson. Rose DeWitt Bu kater. I'll have to get you to write that one down. Come on. I got you. Come on. Come on. Help, please! Help! - Please, help me! - Listen. Listen to me. Listen. Listen to me. I've got you. I won't let go. Now pull yourself up. Come on! Come on. That's right. You can do it. I got you. What's all this? You stand back and... ...don't move an inch! Fetch the Master at Arms. This is completely unacceptable! What made you think that you could put your hands on my fiancée?! Look at me, you filth! Cal. What do you think you were doing? Cal, stop. It was an accident. An accident? It was. Stupid, really. I was leaning over and I slipped. I was leaning far over to see the, uh... ...uh, uh, the uh... - Propellers? - Propellers, and I slipped. And I would have gone overboard but Mr. Dawson here... ...saved me. And almost went over himself. You wanted to see the... She wanted to see the propellers. Like I said, women and machinery do not mix. Was that the way of it? Yeah. Yeah, that was pretty much it. Well, the boy's a hero then. Good for you, son. Well done. So, it's all's well and back to our brandy, eh? Look at you. You must be freezing. Let's get you inside. Perhaps a little something for the boy? Of course. Mr. Lovejoy, I think a 20 should do it. Is that the going rate for saving the woman you love? Rose is displeased. What to do? I know. Perhaps you could join us for dinner tomorrow evening... ...to regale our group... ...with your heroic tale. Sure. Count me in. Good. It's settled then. This should be interesting. Can I bum a smoke? You'll want to tie those. It's interesting... ...the young lady slipped so suddenly... ...and you still had time to remove your jacket and your shoes. I know you've been melancholy. I don't pretend to know why. I intended to save this... ...until the engagement gala next week... ...but, I thought... ...tonight. Good gracious. Perhaps as a reminder of my feelings for you. - Is it a-- - Diamond. Yes. 56 carats to be exact. It was worn by Louis XVI. And they called it Le Coeur de Ia Mer. - The Heart of the Ocean. - The Heart of the Ocean. Yes. It's overwhelming. Well, it's for royalty. We are royalty, Rose. You know, there's nothing I couldn't give you. There's nothing I'd deny you... ...if you would not deny me. Open your heart to me, Rose. Well, I've been on my own since I was 15, since my folks died. And I had no brothers or sisters or close kin in that part of the country... ...so I lit on out of there and I haven't been back since. You could just call me a tumbleweed blowing in the wind. Well, Rose, we've walked about a mile around this boat deck and... ...chewed over how great the weather's been and how I grew up... ...but I reckon that's not why you came to talk to me, is it? - Mr. Dawson, I-- - Jack. Jack. I want to thank you for what you did. Not just for pulling me back, but for your discretion. You're welcome. Look. I know what you must be thinking. Poor little rich girl. What does she know about misery? No. No, that's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... ---what could have happened to this girl to make her think she had no way out? Well I... It was everything. It was my whole world and... ...all the people in it. And the inertia of my life, plunging ahead and me... ...powerless to stop it. God, look at that thing. You would have gone straight to the bottom. 500 invitations have gone out. All of Philadelphia society will be there. And all the while I feel I'm... ...standing in the middle of a crowded room... ...screaming at the top of my lungs... ...and no one even looks up. Do you love him? Pardon me? Do you love him? You're being very rude. You shouldn't be asking me this. Well, it's a simple question. Do you love the guy or not? This is not a suitable conversation. VVhy can't you just answer the question? This is absurd. You don't know me and I don't know you... ...and we are not having this conversation at all. You are rude... ...and uncouth and presumptuous and I am leaving now... ...Jack. Mr. Dawson. It's been a pleasure. I sought you out to thank you and now I have thanked you. And you've insulted me. Well, you deserved it. - Right. - Right. I thought you were leaving. I am. You are so annoying. Wait. I don't have to leave. This is my part of the ship. You leave. Well, well, well. Now who's being rude? What is this stupid thing you're carrying around? So, what are you, an artist or something? These are rather good. They're very good, actually. Jack, this is exquisite work. Ah, they didn't think too much of them in old Paree. Paris? You do get around for a p-- Well, a-- a person of limited means. Go on. A poor guy. You can say it. Well, well, well. And these were drawn from life? Well, that's one of the good things about Paris. Lots of girls are willing to take their clothes off. You liked this woman. You used her several times. Well. She had beautiful hands, you see? I think you must have had a love affair with her. No, no, no. Just with her hands. She was a one-legged prostitute. See? She had a good sense of humor though. Oh, and this lady... She used to sit at this bar every night... ...wearing every piece of jewelry she owned... ...just waiting for her long, lost love. We called her Madame Bijoux. See, her clothes are all moth-eaten. Well, you have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people. I see you. And? You wouldn't have jumped. But the purpose of university is to find a suitable husband. Rose has already done that. Look, here comes that vulgar Brown woman. Quickly, get up before she sits with us. Hello, girls. I was hoping I'd catch you at tea. We're awfully sorry, you missed it. The Countess and I were just off to take the air on the boat deck. What a lovely idea. I need to catch up on my gossip. Countess. So, you've not yet lit the last four boilers? No, I don't see the need. We are making excellent time. The press knows the size of Titanic. Now, I want them to marvel at her speed. We must give them something new to print. This maiden voyage of Titanic must... ...make headlines. Mr. lsmay, I would prefer not to push the engines... ...until they've been properly run in. Of course I'm just a passenger. I leave it to your good offices to decide what's best. But what a glorious end to your final crossing... ...if we were to get into New York on Tuesday night... ...and surprise them all. Make the morning papers. Retire with a bang, eh, E.J.? Good man. After that, I worked on a squid boat in Monterey... ...then I went to Los Angeles to the... ...Santa Monica pier and did portraits for 10 cents each. Why can't I be like you? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it. Say we'll go there sometime, to that pier... only if we just talk about it No, we'll do it. We'll drink cheap beer. Ride on the roller coaster till we throw up We'll ride horses on the beach, in the surf. But you have to do it like a real cowboy. No sidesaddle stuff. You mean with one leg on each side? Can you show me? Sure, if you like. Teach me to ride like a man. Chew tobacco like a man. And spit like a man. You didn't learn in finishing school? No. Come on, I'll show you. I'll show you how. Jack! No, Jack, no. Wait. I couldn't possibly, Jack. Watch closely. That's disgusting. Your turn That was pitiful. You really have to hawk it back. Get some leverage. Use your arms. Arc your neck. You see the range on that thing? Okay, go. That was better. You have to work on it. Really try to hawk it up. Mother. May I introduce Jack Dawson? Charmed, I'm sure. The others were gracious and curious about the man who'd saved my life. But my mother looked at him like an insect. A dangerous insect which must be squashed quickly. Sounds like you're a good man to have around in a sticky spot. Why do they always insist on announcing dinner like a damn cavalry charge? Shall we go dress, Mother? See you at dinner, Jack. Uh, son? Son! Do you have any idea what you're doing? Not really. You're about to go into the snake pit. What are you going to wear? I figured. Come on. I was right. You and my son are just about the same size. Pretty close. You shine up like a new penny. Good evening, sir. Thousands of tons of Hockley steel are in this ship. - Which part? - All the right ones. Then you're accountable if there's a problem. Where's Rose? She'll be along. There is the Countess. I saw that in a nickelodeon and always wanted to do it. Darling... ...surely you remember Mr. Dawson. It's amazing. You could almost pass for a gentleman. Almost. This is extraordinary. This is a remarkable voyage. - Mad. - Completely lunatic. There's the Countess of Rothes. That's John Jacob Astor... ...the richest man on board. His little wifey, Madeleine, is my age and in a delicate condition. See how she tries to hide it. Quite the scandal. Benjamin Guggenheim and his mistress, Madame Aubert. Mrs. Guggenheim... ...is at home with the children, of course. And over here... ...Sir Cosmo and Lucile, Lady Duff-Gordon. She designs naughty lingerie, among her many talents. Very popular with the royals. Congratulations. She's splendid. Why, thank you. Escort a lady to dinner? Certainly. Sweet pea, sweet pea. Ain't nothing to it. They love money. Pretend like you own a gold mine and you're in the club. Hey, Astor. Hello, Molly. Nice to see you. J.J., Madeleine, I'd like you to meet Jack Dawson. Well, Jack... ...are you of the Boston Dawsons? No, the Chippewa Falls Dawsons, actually. Oh, yes. He must have been nervous, but he never faltered. They assumed he was one of them. Heir to a rail road fortune, perhaps. New money, obviously, but still a member of the club. Mother, of course, could always be counted upon. Tell us of the accommodations in steerage Mr- Dawson- I hear they're quite good- The best I've seen, ma'am. Hardly any rats. Mr. Dawson is joining us from third class. He was of help to my fiancée last night. It happens Mr. Dawson is quite a fine artist. He showed me some of his work today. Rose and I differ in our definition of fine art. Not to impugn your work, sir. Are all these mine? Start from the outside and work in. He knows every rivet in her. Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Thank you, Rose. How do you take your caviar, sir? No caviar for me, thanks. Never did like it much. Where exactly do you live, Mr. Dawson? Right now, my address is the RMS Titanic. After that, I'm on God's good humor. How do you have means to travel? I work my way from place to place. Tramp steamers and such. I won my ticket on Titanic at a lucky hand at poker. A very lucky hand. All life is a game of luck. A real man makes his own luck. Right, Dawson? And you find that sort of rootless existence appealing? Yes, ma'am, I do. I've got everything I need right here with me. I have air in my lungs and blank sheets of paper. I love waking up, not knowing what will happen or who I'll meet. Where I'll wind up. One night I'm sleeping under a bridge... ...now I'm on the grandest ship in the world, with you fine people. I'll take more of that. Life's a gift. I don't intend on wasting it. You never know what hand you'll get dealt. You take life as it comes at you. Here, Cal. Make each day count. Well said, Jack. Hear, hear. To making it count. To making it count. Bravo. But Mr. Brown didn't know I'd hidden the money in the stove. He comes home drunk as a pig celebrating and lights a fire. Next is
